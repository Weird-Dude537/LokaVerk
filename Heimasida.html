    Tally Hall (sometimes stylized as tallyhall) is an American rock band formed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in December 2002, and publicly active until the conclusion of their Good & Evil tour in 2011. The band is known for its upbeat melodies and whimsical lyrics, along with a dedicated fanbase on social media sites. The members originally described their musical style as "wonky rock", later redefining their sound as "fabloo", in an effort to not let their music be defined by any particular genres after critics began defining the characteristics of "wonky rock".

    Tally Hall has five members, each of them distinguished by the color of their neckties: guitarist Rob Cantor (yellow), guitarist Joe Hawley (red), drummer Ross Federman (gray), keyboardist Andrew Horowitz (green), and bassist Zubin Sedghi (blue). Touring partner Casey Shea, producer and roadie Bora Karaca, and host of local radio show Tree Town Sound Matthew Altruda also had dedicated colors for their neckties (black, orange and pink, respectively). All five members have provided vocals for the band.

    Once under the Atlantic Records recording label, Tally Hall was, again, signed to indie label Quack! Media, who previously helped finance and nationally distribute their debut studio album, Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum on October 24, 2005. They released their second album, Good & Evil, on June 24, 2011.

    Some Tally Hall members (Rob Cantor, Joe Hawley, and Zubin Sedghi) also provided the vocals and music for all of the songs in Happy Monster Band, a children's television series that aired on Playhouse Disney.
